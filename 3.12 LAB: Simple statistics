'''
Given 4 floating-point numbers. Use a string formatting expression with conversion specifiers to output their product and their average as integers (rounded), then as floating-point numbers.

Output each rounded integer using the following:
print(f'{your_value:.0f}')
Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.3f}')
Ex: If the input is:

8.3
10.4
5.0
4.8
the output is:

2072 7
2071.680 7.125

#input
num1 = float(input())
num2 = float(input())
num3 = float(input())
num4 = float(input())

#math
product = num1 * num2 * num3 * num4
average = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4) / 4

#Forgot rounding was a built in function :>
rounded_product = round(product)
rounded_average = round(average)

#Ahh After 10,000 years I'm free! Time to conquer Earth!
print(f'{rounded_product:.0f} {rounded_average:.0f}')
print(f'{product:.3f} {average:.3f}')
